# Algorithms & Data Structures

One Simple stop for your curious questions on Data Structures and Algorithms in your favorite languageâ€™s like JavaScript, Python, Swift, etc. [WIP] - Questions and their respective solutions in respective languages are getting added! Help us make more.

## Where are Questions and their respective Answers?

- **Question:** All folders have specific `README.md` where respective question has been asked.
- **Solutions:** All folders have specific `solution-{myfavlanguage}` folder where respective solution(s) have been added. All of those solutions are already tested (all tests passing) with respective test frameworks of respective languages (Example: Jest for JavaScript Testing.)

## Test your Code

Instructions for testing is provided in every `Readme.md` file of your specific `solution-{myfavlanguage}` folder for each respective questions. You can check out one of those as an example [here](./reversestring/solutions-javascript/Readme.md#test-the-solution)
